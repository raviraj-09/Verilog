8-bit ALU with Verilog Testbench
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog, along with a comprehensive testbench that validates its functionality for various arithmetic operations. The design is written in Verilog HDL and can be simulated using tools like ModelSim, Vivado, or Icarus Verilog.

The ALU supports:
Addition (4'b0000)
Subtraction (4'b0001)
Multiplication (4'b0010)
Division (4'b0011)
Invalid operation handling (default case)
Division by zero detection (outputs 0xAC)

ðŸ“‚ Files Included
alu_8bit.sv â†’ ALU design module.
alu_8bit_tb.sv â†’ Self-checking testbench with multiple test cases.

âš™ Features
Synchronous design with clock and reset.
Carry flag support for addition.
Self-checking testbench with $error reporting.
Covers edge cases like overflow, zero operands, and division by zero.
Easily extensible to add more ALU operations.
